# Hangman

## Table of Contents

## Project description
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

I am undertaking this project as part of my journey studying with AiCore. With this, I aim to improve my experience with coding- specifically in Python.
So far, this project has taught me not just about using Python, but also about version control via Git and Github.

## Installation instructions

## Usage instructions
At the start of the game, the computer will select a word from a predefined list. The player will then be asked for an input in the form of a single letter.
The player will then be told if their chosen letter belongs in the word.
